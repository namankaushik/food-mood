            <h3>Transcript</h3>
            <p>Welcome to another deliciously insightful episode of Food and Mood Bites. I am your host, Theanch, and today we are diving into the world of gut health heroes: Dhokla and Lassi.</p>
            <p>With me is a nutrition guru, Mr. Yush, who is here to spill the beans—or should I say the yogurt? How are you, Yush?</p>
            <p>Well, thank you, Theanch, for inviting me to the podcast. I am excited as always. Today’s dishes are not only delicious, but also incredibly good for your gut, which, as we’ll discuss, is like the control room of your mood.</p>
            <p>Control room? That sounds fancy. Let’s not waste time. First up: Dhokla. It’s a steamed savory cake that’s basically a cloud you can eat. So why is Dhokla such a gut health superstar?</p>
            <p>Dhokla is a fermented dish made from rice and chickpea flour. The fermentation process creates probiotics, which are beneficial bacteria that keep your gut healthy. When your gut is happy, your brain is happy—it’s the gut-brain connection in action.</p>
            <p>That’s incredible. Making Dhokla is simple but feels like magic. You ferment a batter of rice and chickpea flour, pour it into a tray, steam it, and top it with tempering of mustard seeds and curry leaves. Light, fluffy, and honestly addictive!</p>
            <p>Now let’s talk about Lassi, the OG yogurt drink from Punjab. Why is Lassi so refreshing?</p>
            <p>Lassi is made with yogurt, which, like Dhokla, is rich in probiotics. These probiotics support a healthy gut, regulate serotonin, and reduce stress. It’s also hydrating and great for digestion!</p>
            <p>So, Lassi is a mood booster and a thirst quencher—win-win!</p>
            <p>Exactly! Whether sweet or salty, Lassi is a powerhouse drink. It’s so easy to make—blend yogurt with water, sugar, or salt, and add flavors like rose water or cardamom. Chill it, and you’re good to go.</p>
            <p>And that’s it for today’s episode! Thank you, Yush, for your insights, and thank you, listeners, for joining us on this journey. See you until next time on Food and Mood Bites. Take care and keep your gut and mood happy!</p>
