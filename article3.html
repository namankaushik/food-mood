        <h3>Ancient Foundational Heritage of Ayurvedic Herbal Practices</h3>
        <p>
            With culinary heritage based largely on ancient traditions, cultural practices, and religious beliefs in South Asia, 
            including India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan, and the Maldives, the cuisine of this region 
            is not just nutrition but an expression of identity, community, and spirituality. This article examines the 
            historical, cultural, and health aspects of South Asian food identities, emphasizing their enduring importance.
        </p>
        <p>
            South Asian culinary traditions draw on ancient practices such as Ayurveda, a holistic health system developed 
            in India between 2500 and 500 B.C. It provides energy (Ferro-Well, 1977).
        </p>
        <p>
            Staples like lentils, rice, and <em>kojra</em> were central to the menu, which included a variety of vegetables, 
            fruits, and dairy products. Spices like turmeric, ginger, and cumin were used not only for their flavor but also 
            for medicinal purposes. For example, turmeric was regarded for its anti-inflammatory properties, a practice 
            that has been recognized by modern science (Rathi, Riddell & Worsley, 2018).
        </p>
        <h3>Religious Influences on Food Choices</h3>
        <p>
            Religious beliefs have played an important role in shaping South Asian cuisine. Vegetarianism is encouraged 
            in Hinduism, and certain foods are considered either pure (<em>sattvic</em>) or impure (<em>tama</em>). 
            Festivals like Navratri encourage fasting and consumption of sattvic foods such as fruits, nuts, and dairy 
            products (Ferro-Luzzi, 1977).
        </p>
        <p>
            Similarly, Islamic food laws in Pakistan and Bangladesh mandate the use of <em>halal</em> food, which ensures 
            food is prepared following specific guidelines.
