            <h3>Transcript</h3>
            <p>Welcome back to Food and Mood Bites. Today we are exploring the immune-boosting side of comfort food with two iconic dishes: Haldi Doodh or Golden Milk, and Saag Paneer.</p>
            <p>With us is Devang Acharya, who will help us understand why these dishes are not only good for your soul but also great for your immune system. Ready, Devang?</p>
            <p>Absolutely. They are two of my all-time favorites, not just for their health benefits, but also for the memories they bring.</p>
            <p>Let’s start with Haldi Doodh, which my grandma swore could cure everything short of a broken heart. Haldi Doodh is a turmeric-based drink that’s been part of Indian households for generations. Why is it so magical, Devang?</p>
            <p>Turmeric is the star of the show here. It contains curcumin, a compound with powerful anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. This helps to reduce oxidative stress in the body, lower inflammation, and improve mood. Plus, it looks like liquid sunshine.</p>
            <p>How does it help with immunity? Can you explain a bit?</p>
            <p>Yes, certainly! Haldi Doodh supports the immune system by modulating inflammation. Adding black pepper enhances curcumin's absorption, making it even more effective. The milk provides calcium and vitamin D, which are crucial for overall health.</p>
            <p>To make it, you heat milk with turmeric, black pepper, and a touch of honey or jaggery. It’s warm, comforting, and honestly feels like a lullaby in a cup.</p>
            <p>Exactly! And if you’re lactose-intolerant, you can use almond or coconut milk. It works just as well.</p>
            <p>Now let’s move on to dish two: Saag Paneer, a Punjabi classic that combines nutrient-rich greens with creamy paneer. What makes this dish so special?</p>
            <p>Saag Paneer is packed with leafy greens like spinach and mustard greens, which are high in folate, magnesium, and vitamin C. These nutrients boost immunity, support brain health, and reduce stress.</p>
            <p>And what about the paneer? Let’s be honest, that’s my favorite part!</p>
            <p>Paneer adds a good dose of protein and calcium, making this dish a complete meal. The healthy fats in paneer also help absorb fat-soluble vitamins from the greens.</p>
            <p>Cooking Saag Paneer is a labor of love. You blanch and puree the greens, simmer them with spices, and then add paneer cubes. It’s earthy, hearty, and just the thing for a cold evening.</p>
            <p>It’s also a great dish for meal prepping. Make a big batch, reheat it during the week, and enjoy—because it tastes even better the next day!</p>
            <p>Wow, that’s it for today. Whether it’s a cup of Haldi Doodh or a plate of Saag Paneer, these dishes are a delicious way to stay healthy and happy.</p>
            <p>Thanks for joining me, Devang, and thank you, listeners, for tuning in. See you next time!</p>
            <p>Yeah, don’t forget to sprinkle a little love into everything you cook. Until we meet next time, stay healthy, guys!</p>
