            <h3>Transcript</h3>
            <p>Welcome to Food and Mood Bites. I am the one Chaaria, and today we are diving into two incredibly mood-boosting dishes: Gujarati Khichdi and Haryanvi Bajra Khichdi. With us is our great nutritionist, Yash Patel, who will walk us through the science behind why these dishes are as good for the mood as they are for the taste buds.</p>
            <p>Let's get started. Khichdi is a simple yet iconic Gujarati comfort food made with rice, lentils, and turmeric. Why is this dish so special?</p>
            <p>Well, thank you for inviting me to this podcast. I think that Khichdi is a wonderful dish because it's easy on the digestive system, making it perfect for reducing your physical and mental stress. The combination of rice and lentils provides all nine essential amino acids, creating a complete protein profile for your body. This balance supports stable energy levels and prevents mood swings.</p>
            <p>What about turmeric? It's often referred to as a superfood.</p>
            <p>Exactly! Turmeric contains curcumin, which has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Research shows that curcumin can reduce inflammation in the brain, which is linked to depression and anxiety. Adding a pinch of black pepper enhances curcumin absorption, making the dish even more effective.</p>
            <p>That's fascinating. Cooking Khichdi is so simple: start by rinsing rice and dal, then saut√© cumin seeds and turmeric in ghee before adding the rice-dal mix. Simmer until creamy, and you have a soothing, delicious meal.</p>
            <p>Now let's talk about Bajra Khichdi. It's a hearty dish made with pearl millet and lentils. Yash, what makes this dish a mood booster?</p>
            <p>Well, personally, I eat Bajra Khichdi once every week. Bajra is rich in magnesium, a mineral crucial for managing stress. Magnesium helps reduce cortisol levels, the stress hormone, promoting relaxation. Bajra also contains slow-digesting carbs, providing sustained energy without spikes or crashes.</p>
            <p>I mean, I've also heard that magnesium is good for sleep. Is that true?</p>
            <p>Yes, magnesium supports melatonin production, which regulates sleep-wake cycles. A well-rested body is a happier body, and dishes like Bajra Khichdi can help improve your overall mood and sleep quality.</p>
            <p>To make Bajra Khichdi, we simply soak the millet for 30 minutes, then cook it with lentils, onions, and spices. It's hearty, healthy, and perfect for colder days.</p>
            <p>Thank you so much for tuning in to try these dishes and enjoy the comfort they bring. See you next time on Food and Mood Bites. Thank you!</p>
