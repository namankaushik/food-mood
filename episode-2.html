            <h3>Transcript</h3>
            <p>Hello and welcome to our Episode Two: Calming Dishes with Kadhi and Sarso Da Saag. On today's episode, we are focusing on two dishes that calm the mind and rejuvenate the body.</p>
            <p>Today, we have Yash Patel with us. Yash, why are these dishes great for calming the mind?</p>
            <p>Well, firstly, thank you for inviting me to this podcast. Both dishes, Gujarati Kadhi and Punjabi Sarso Da Saag, use ingredients like yogurt and leafy greens, which are rich in nutrients that support mental health. They are grounding, nutrient-dense, and perfect for reducing stress and anxiety.</p>
            <p>Kadhi is a light yogurt-based curry. How does yogurt contribute to mental well-being?</p>
            <p>Yogurt is rich in probiotics, which support gut health. Since the gut and brain are closely connected through the gut-brain axis, a healthy gut can improve your mood, reduce anxiety, and even enhance your mental clarity.</p>
            <p>That's fascinating. Cooking Kadhi involves whisking yogurt with chickpea flour and spices, then simmering it to a creamy consistency. What makes it even better is the tempering of curry leaves and turmeric.</p>
            <p>You’re right! Turmeric, as we discussed earlier in Podcast One, has anti-inflammatory properties, while curry leaves provide antioxidant benefits. This combination enhances the dish’s calming effect.</p>
            <p>Let’s move on to Sarso Da Saag, a Punjabi classic. What makes mustard greens so special?</p>
            <p>That’s a great question. Mustard greens are high in folate, a nutrient essential for producing serotonin, the brain’s mood-regulating chemical. They are also rich in antioxidants like Vitamin C, Vitamin D, and Omega-3s, which help reduce oxidative stress.</p>
            <p>It’s impressive. Cooking Sarso Da Saag involves simmering mustard greens with spinach and maize flour, then finishing it with a flavorful tempering of garlic and ginger.</p>
            <p>Yes, adding spinach enhances the folate content, while garlic and ginger provide anti-inflammatory benefits. These dishes are both nutritious and deeply satisfying.</p>
            <p>Let’s give these dishes a try and let us know how they bring calm into your life. Until we meet next time, stay happy and healthy!</p>
