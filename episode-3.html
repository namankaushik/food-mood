            <h3>Transcript</h3>
            <p>Hello and welcome back to Food and Mood Bites. Welcome to Podcast Three, Comfort Food. We are diving into the warm, gooey world of comfort foods. Think of today's episode as a cozy hug in audio form.</p>
            <p>I'm your host, Yash Patel, with me as always, is our resident nutrition wizard, Mr. Habib. Say hello, Mr. Habib!</p>
            <p>Hello everyone! I’m not sure about being a wizard, but if I had the magic wand, I’d ensure everyone has access to the delicious comfort foods we’re about to discuss.</p>
            <p>Wow, Mr. Habib, I like your accent. Spoken like a true foodie! Today we are covering two absolute legends: Punjabi Aloo Paratha and Gujarati Handvo. By the end of this episode, you might just find yourself in the kitchen whipping up a feast. Shall we get into it?</p>
            <p>Let’s kick things off with Aloo Paratha. Picture this: a flaky, buttery bread stuffed with spiced potatoes. It’s the stuff dreams—and very happy stomachs—are made of. Mr. Habib, what do you think of this dish and why is it the pinnacle of comfort food?</p>
            <p>Well, let’s start with the potatoes. Potatoes are like the therapist of the vegetable world—always there to comfort you when you need them. They are packed with potassium, which helps regulate blood pressure and calm the nervous system. The complex carbs in potatoes are serotonin’s best friends, helping stabilize your mood.</p>
            <p>Well, so basically he’s saying that potatoes are edible hugs. Got it! Now let’s talk about the process. Making Aloo Paratha is surprisingly simple:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Step 1: Boil some potatoes and mash them like they owe you money.</li>
                <li>Step 2: Spice them up with cumin, coriander, and maybe a little garam masala. If you don’t know about garam masala, ask any of your Indian friends!</li>
                <li>Step 3: Stuff that magic into dough, roll it out, and cook it on a hot griddle with ghee.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Easy, right? And don’t forget that ghee contains healthy fats that nourish the brain and improve cognitive function. It’s like the smart, older sibling of butter.</p>
            <p>Wow, that sounds fancy. True. Also, a pro-tip I’d like to give my audience: If your paratha tears while rolling it out, just call it rustic and move on. No one’s judging you.</p>
            <p>What’s your favorite memory of Aloo Paratha, Mr. Habib?</p>
            <p>My food choices are different, but my grandma used to make parathas in the morning, which I ate with homemade yogurt and mango pickle. It was the perfect mix of creamy, spicy, and tangy. Honestly, it felt like a party for my taste buds!</p>
            <p>I love that. For me, it’s all about the crispy edges and that first bite when you hit all the flavors. Aloo Paratha is pure nostalgia on a plate.</p>
            <p>Now let’s move on to our second dish, which is even better: Handvo. Let’s hop over to Gujarat for our second comfort food of the day. If Aloo Paratha is the life of the party, Handvo is the quiet introvert who steals the show once you get to know them. You know, Mr. Habib, I’m pretty sure you’d know some things about Handvo. Let us know what makes Handvo so special.</p>
            <p>Yes, Handvo is high in protein and fiber, thanks to rice and lentil flours. These nutrients keep you full for longer and give you steady energy without the mid-afternoon snack. Plus, the sesame seeds on top are rich in zinc, which supports the brain and boosts the immune system.</p>
            <p>That’s so great! I’ve also heard that the Swiss Army and Indian Army use it as a regular meal.</p>
            <p>So, you’re saying that Handvo isn’t just delicious, but it’s also basically self-care in cake form. Love that! For those who haven’t tried it, Handvo is a savory lentil cake baked to golden perfection. The batter is a mix of rice and lentil flours, grated bottle gourd, ginger, green chilies, and a touch of magic. Don’t forget the tempering—a good tempering of mustard seeds, curry leaves, and sesame seeds is a must and adds crunch that takes the dish to the next level.</p>
            <p>Absolutely! Also, fun fact: Handvo is great for meal prepping. You know, bake a big batch, cut it into squares, and boom—you’ve got snacks for days. It’s like the gift that keeps on giving.</p>
            <p>Oh yeah, that’s true. Aloo Paratha might land the first punch with its crispy, buttery goodness, but Handvo would win on stamina. It’s iron, protein, and fiber, after all.</p>
            <p>Well, fair point. Maybe we should just call it a tie and eat both. I mean, why choose?</p>
            <p>And that wraps up today’s episode of Food and Mood Bites. A big thank you to Mr. Habib for sharing his expertise and his grandma’s love for Aloo Paratha. Take care, everyone, and don’t forget: love is the secret ingredient in every great dish. Thank you!</p>
